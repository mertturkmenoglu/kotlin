* Array contains **both** *positive* and *negative* numbers.
* Rearrange array that positive and negative numbers are *placed
alternatively*.
* Positive and negative number count **does not** have to be equal.
* If there are more positive/negative elements, they appear at the
end of the array.  
* Example: 
    ```
    [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9] --> [9, -7, 8, -3, 5, -1, 2, 4, 6]
    ```
