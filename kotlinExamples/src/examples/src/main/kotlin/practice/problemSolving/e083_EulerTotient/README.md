# Euler Totient Function
***
* Original problem description: https://www.codewars.com/kata/53c9157c689f841d16000c03
* Function counts positive integer numbers such that <= to n and that
are relatively prime to n.
* Example:
    ```
    n = 9
    1 <= k <= 9 --> 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 
    ```
* f(9) = 6 and f(1) = 1.
* Function should take an integer **1 <= 9** and return **f(n)**
